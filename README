# ME35 Midterm
**Name**: Phila Dlamini

## Project Description:
- This project builds a temperature sensor that physically displays the temperature it reads using LEDs and posts the data to Adafruit.
- The sensor allows users to change the temperature units on the display by using a gamepad or by changing the color in an Airtable database.

## File Descriptions:
- `midterm.py` --> Contains the main code in the project. This code runs on the Pico and is responsible for reading the temperature values and posting them.
- `gamepad.py` --> Contains the gamepad library that allows us to interface with the gamepad.
- `mqq.py` --> Contains the MQTT library used to connect to Adafruit.
- image_processing.py --> Used for image processing: identifies the color with the largest blob in the supplied image
